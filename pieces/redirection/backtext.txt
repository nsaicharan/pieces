Hi Dan,

I think there won't any problem with Rapidweaver. I've removed JavaScript and simplified the PHP code so that you could easily implement it in your project. The only requirement is - the software should allow you to copy-paste some PHP code in the page (index.php) and change the URL of buttons (links). 

Here's what you need to do: 

Place the below code at top of your index file.

<!-- START PHP CODE -->
<?php

if (isset($_GET['subdomain'])) {

$cookie_name = 'subdomain';
$cookie_value = $_GET['subdomain'];

setcookie($cookie_name, $cookie_value, time() + (86400 * 30), "/");

header("Location: http://$cookie_value.gotopkick.com/");

}

if (isset($_COOKIE['subdomain'])) {

$subdomain = $_COOKIE['subdomain'];

header("Location: http://$subdomain.gotopkick.com/");
}

?>
<!-- END PHP CODE -->
 
After that, you've to change the URL of buttons into this format: "?subdomain=YOURSUBDOMAINNAMEHERE".

For example:

The current URL of your "South Riding" button is "http://1southriding.gotopkick.com/" -  it should be changed to "?subdomain=1southriding".

In the same way, you should also change the URL of other buttons (Potomac Falls, Broadlands, Purcellville, Leesburg).
